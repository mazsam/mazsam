# Hey there! 👋

I'm Samsul Arifin—a Software Engineer who loves turning caffeine and code into sleek React.js & Next.js web apps.

I believe the web should be fun, fast, and beautiful (with a dash of minimalism)!  
When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new tech, tweaking pixels, or chasing the perfect cup of coffee.
